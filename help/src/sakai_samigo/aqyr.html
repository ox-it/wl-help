<h2>Creating questions for an assessment</h2>













<p>Creating questions is only one of the steps involved in creating an
assessment. Consider also reading the following documents:
</p><ul><li><a href="/portal/help/TOCDisplay/content.hlp?docId=ardm">Creating a new assessment</a></li><li><a href="/portal/help/TOCDisplay/content.hlp?docId=arag">Assessment settings</a>
</li></ul>

<p>You can choose from several types of questions when building an
assessment. Before you begin adding questions, consider reviewing the
different types available, which are outlined in the document <a href="/portal/help/TOCDisplay/content.hlp?docId=argy">Types of questions available for assessments</a>.</p>




<p>In the <a href="/portal/help/TOCDisplay/content.hlp?docId=arcc">menubar</a> of the relevant course or project site,
click . To create questions for an assessment, you
will use the authoring tool on the Assessments page. To create a new
assessment, under the "New Assessment" heading, type a name for your
assessment in the "Title:" field, and then click <strong><code>Create</code></strong>. You
may base the assessment on a saved template by choosing the template
from the "Choose Existing Template" drop-down list. You also can
import an assessment by using the Import feature. For more
information, see <a href="/portal/help/TOCDisplay/content.hlp?docId=aqys">Importing or exporting an assessment</a>.

</p><p><a name="topb"> </a>

To begin adding questions to a new assessment, choose the type of
question you want to add from the "Add Question:" drop-down
menu. Below, you'll find instructions for each question type:
</p><ul><li><a href="#mult">Multiple Choice</a></li><li><a href="#survey">Survey</a></li><li><a href="#essay">Short Answer/Essay</a></li><li><a href="#fib">Fill in the Blank</a></li><li><a href="#mat">Matching</a></li><li><a href="#true">True/False</a></li><li><a href="#file">File Upload</a></li><li><a href="#upload">Copy from Question Pool</a></li></ul>

<a name="mult"> </a><h4>Multiple Choice</h4>

<p>To create a Multiple Choice question, follow these steps:</p>
<ol><li>In the Questions screen, from the "Add Question:" drop-down list,
select <strong><code>Multiple Choice</code></strong>. This takes you to the editing screen.<br /><br />
</li><li>In the "Answer Point Value:" field, enter the point value you want
to assign to this question. Enter <code>0</code> (zero) if you wish
this to be an ungraded question.


</li><li>In the "Question Text" field, enter the text for the question.<br /><br />
</li><li>In the "Answer:" section, click the radio buttons to choose
between <strong><code>Single correct answer</code></strong> (the default) and <strong><code>Multiple
Correct Answers</code></strong>. As you change the selection, the screen will
refresh to allow or hide the requisite fields.  <br /><br />
</li><li>In the case of a single correct answer, you'll see four sets of
text boxes for possible answers and optional feedback. To indicate
which answer is the correct one, click the radio button next to it. In
the case of multiple correct answers, check the boxes beside the
correct responses.

<p>If you want to present fewer possible answers, click
<strong><code>Remove</code></strong> beneath the text boxes you want to remove. If you want
to present more possibilities, use the drop-down list next to "Insert
additional answers:" to select the number of possibilities you want to
add.</p>
</li><li>If you want the possible answers to appear in a random order, next
to "Randomize Answers:", click <strong><code>Yes</code></strong>. To have them appear in
the order you see in the question editing screen (the default), click
<strong><code>No</code></strong>.<br /><br />
</li><li>If you want to require users to provide a rationale for choosing
an answer, next to "Required Rationale:", click <strong><code>Yes</code></strong>. If you
don't require a rationale (the default), click <strong><code>No</code></strong>.<br /><br />
</li><li>From the "Assign to Part:" drop-down list, choose the part (i.e.,
section) to which you want to assign this question. Leave this as
the default value if you haven't created any parts.<br /><br />
</li><li>If you want to assign this question to a question pool, from the
"Assign to question pool:" drop-down list, select the desired pool
name.<br /><br />
</li><li>Under "Correct/Incorrect answer feedback:", you can provide
question-level feedback for correct and/or incorrect answers. 
<br /><br /></li><li>When you're finished, click <strong><code>Save</code></strong> to return to the
assessment editing screen. You'll see that your new question has been
added to the assessment.
</li></ol>

<a name="survey"> </a><h4>Survey</h4>

<p>The process for creating a Survey question is
similar to that used to create a Multiple Choice question, except for
the following differences:</p>
<ul><li>The "Answer Point Value:" field is default <code>0</code>
(zero). <br /><br />
</li><li>For the text of possible answers, you must choose from a
predefined set of scales commonly used for survey reporting. To select
the scale you want to use, click its corresponding radio button. The
choices are as follows:<br /><br />

<ul><li><strong><code>Yes, No</code></strong></li><li><strong><code>Disagree, Agree</code></strong></li><li><strong><code>Disagree, Undecided, Agree</code></strong></li><li><strong><code>Below Average -&gt; Above Average</code></strong></li><li><strong><code>Strongly Disagree -&gt; Strongly Agree</code></strong></li><li><strong><code>Unacceptable -&gt; Excellent</code></strong></li><li><strong><code>1 -&gt; 5</code></strong></li><li><strong><code>1 -&gt; 10</code></strong></li></ul><br />
</li><li>You do not have the option to randomize answers or require a
rationale.
</li></ul>
<a href="#topb">Back to top</a>
<a name="essay"> </a><h4>Short Answer/Essay</h4>

<p>
To create a Short Answer/Essay question, follow these steps:
</p>

<ol><li>In the Questions screen, from the "Add Question:"
drop-down list, select <strong><code>Short Answer/Essay</code></strong>.<br /><br />
</li><li>In the "Answer Point Value:" field, enter the point value you want
to assign to this question. Enter <code>0</code> (zero) if you wish
this to be an ungraded question.<br /><br />
</li><li>In the "Question Text" field, enter the text for the question.

<br /><br />
</li><li>From the "Assign to Part:" drop-down list, choose the part (i.e.,
section) to which you want to assign this question. Leave this as the
default value if you haven't created any parts.<br /><br />
</li><li>If you want to assign this question to a question pool, from the
"Assign to question pool:" drop-down list, select the desired
pool name.<br /><br />
</li><li>In the "Answer:" section, you can opt to provide a model short
answer or question-level feedback by typing it in the provided
fields.<br /><br />
</li><li>When you're finished, click <strong><code>Save</code></strong> to return to the
assessment editing screen. You'll see that your new question has been
added to the assessment.
</li></ol>

<a href="#topb">Back to top</a>
<a name="fib"> </a><h4>Fill in the Blank</h4>

<p>To create a Fill in the Blank question, follow these steps:</p>
<ol><li>In the Questions screen, from the "Add Question:"
drop-down list, select <strong><code>Fill in the Blank</code></strong>.<br /><br />
</li><li>In the "Answer Point Value:" field, enter the point value you want
to assign to this question. Enter <code>0</code> (zero) if you wish
this to be an ungraded question.



</li><li>In the "Question Text:" field, enter the text for the
question. Place curly braces (<code> { } </code>)
around words requiring a blank, for example:

<span class="example">  In Unix, to find the current directory path, type {pwd} at the prompt.</span>

<p>
If more than one response is correct for a given blank, or if you want
to allow for alternate spellings, use pipes
(<code> | </code>) to separate the alternate responses, for
example:</p>
<span class="example">  Much to everyone's surprise, Darth Vader actually was Luke
  Skywalker's {father | dad | poppa | pops | daddy}.</span>

<p>For questions with more than one blank, each response is mutually
exclusive, meaning that each blank must contain a distinct
response. Take the following example:</p>
<span class="example">  The colors of the American flag are {red | white | blue}, {red | white | blue}, and {red | white | blue}.</span>

<p>
For the above, the grading engine looks for three distinct answers. To
answer correctly, the user must respond with some combination of red,
white, and blue.</p>
</li><li>From the "Assign to Part:" drop-down list, choose the part (i.e.,
section) to which you want to assign this question. Leave this as the
default value if you haven't created any parts.<br /><br />
</li><li>If you want to assign this question to a question pool, from the
"Assign to question pool:" drop-down list, select the desired
pool name.<br /><br />
</li><li>Under "Correct/Incorrect answer feedback:", you may choose to
provide question-level feedback.  <br /><br />
</li><li>When you're finished, click <strong><code>Save</code></strong> to return to the
Questions screen. You'll see that your new question has been
added to the assessment.
