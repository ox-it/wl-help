<h2>Chat Room: Overview</h2>

<h3>What it does</h3>

<p>You can use the Chat Room tool for real-time, unstructured
conversations among site participants who are signed on to the site at
the same time.</p>

<p>Instructors can easily create an "Online Office Hours" chat room for
student questions and answers. Dispersed collaboration groups can use
Chat as a space to have conversations across distances or catch up
with conversations that they may have missed.</p>

<h3>Key concepts</h3>
<p><strong>Multiple rooms:</strong> The Chat Room tool allows for more
than one room that a site owner (or anyone with the appropriate
permissions) can create for specific kinds of conversation. These
additional chat rooms can be created using the Options feature.</p>

<p><strong>Display:</strong> Changes that a site owner makes to a chat
room display using the <strong><code>Options...</code></strong> button also apply to how
the Chat Room features appear to students.</p>

<h3>Things to consider</h3>
<ul><li>The Chat Room tool alerts users to the other participants who are
also logged into the site and have entered the same chat room. This
way, users know who is available to talk.  <br /><br />
</li><li>Chat messages are saved and visible to all users so that all site
participants can benefit from clarifying conversations and questions
and answers. By default, all Chat messages are shown for at least
three days.<br /><br />
</li><li>The Chat Room tool does not provide a way to chat privately. By
default, all messages are visible to all participants. However, you
can remove read access for a particular role, and thereby for all
participants with that role, by modifying the Chat Room permissions.
</li></ul>
